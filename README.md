In this project I sought to use a bioinformatics study that detailed the genes most heavily correlated with high muscle growth in order to assess how much was someone's nutrition conducive to their muscle growth.

The paper listed around 300 genes that were most implicated in the highest muscle growth group.  

I create a data collection pipeline that inputted the genes, searched for protein products, then queried any vitamins or cofactors necessary.

The dataframe would be the genes, their correlation with muscle growth in the paper, and the vitamins and cofactors needed to operate the protein products of the genes.

The regression model was attempted with low R squared values, leading to the belief that the there is not enough data to construct this model.
